Project Description: A program written in Python to output the closing time of the movie theater I work at.
In response to one of the most common questions from managers and employees who close the theater, "What
time do we close tonight?"

Functionality:
	- Scrapes Fandango for the day's movie times
	- Sorts the movie times chronologically
	- Adds 20 minutes to the last movie time and outputs the result in 12-hour clock format

Timeline: Approx. 2 days

NOTES:
	- The theater closes 20 minutes after the last showing.
